# SADPonzi: Detecting and Characterizing Ponzi Schemes inEthereum Smart Contracts

SADPonzi is a detection for Ponzi scheme smart contracts (ponzitract) base on symbolic execution technology. We implement it atop [teEther](https://github.com/nescio007/teether):



### Ground Truth Benchmark[link](https://github.com/Kenun99/SADPonzi/tree/main/dataset/rq1)

We filter the dataset used in https://github.com/blockchain-unica/ethereum-ponzi and get 133 ground truth ponzitracts (see our paper for details). At the meantimes, we collect 1262 DApp as non-Ponzi cases from dapptotal.com.  





### Robustness Benchark[link](https://github.com/Kenun99/SADPonzi/tree/main/dataset/rq2)

We generate four groups of data for the robustness experiment.



### Large Scale Dataset[link](https://github.com/Kenun99/SADPonzi/tree/main/dataset/rq3)

We apply SADPonzi to all the 3.4 million smart contracts deployed by EOAs in Ethereum and identify 835 Ponzi scheme smart contracts in total, with a volume of over 17 million US Dollar invested from victims. .
