# SADPonzi: Detecting and Characterizing Ponzi Schemes inEthereum Smart Contracts

SADPonzi is a detection for Ponzi scheme smart contracts (ponzitract) base on symbolic execution technology. We implement it atop 

[teEther](https://github.com/nescio007/teether):

### Ground Truth Benchmark

We filter the dataset used in https://github.com/blockchain-unica/ethereum-ponzi and get 133 ground truth ponzitracts (see our paper for details). At the meantimes, we collect 1395 DApp as non-Ponzi cases from dapptotal.com.  

### Robustness Benchark





### Large Scale Dataset

We apply SADPonzi to all the 3.4 million smart contracts deployed by EOAs in Ethereum and identify 835 Ponzi scheme smart contracts in total, with a volume of over 17 million US Dollar invested from victims. .
